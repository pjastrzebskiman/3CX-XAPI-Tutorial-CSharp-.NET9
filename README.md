![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-9.0-blue)

## Project Description

Based on the [official 3CX XAPI tutorial](https://github.com/3cx/xapi-tutorial), I have prepared a set of sample 3CX API calls in C# using the .NET 9 platform. This project aims to simplify integration with the 3CX API and serves as a practical guide for developers.

## Features

- **API Call Examples**: Includes ready-to-use examples for various 3CX API endpoints.
- **Client-Specific Scenarios**: Implements several unique scenarios tailored to client needs, with parts that are universally applicable.
- **Scalability**: The project will be continuously developed with new endpoints and method examples to reflect the latest capabilities of the 3CX API.
- **Tutorial**: A basic guide for handling the 3CX API version 20 (XAPI), facilitating learning and implementation.

## Contents

- `Program.cs`: The main program file containing API call implementations and specific scenarios.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- **.NET 9 SDK**: Ensure you have .NET 9.0 installed. You can download it from the [official Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).
- **3CX API**: Access to a 3CX instance with the XAPI enabled.
